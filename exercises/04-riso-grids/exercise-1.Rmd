# Exercise 1

Determine the center point (`x` and `y`) and the starting and ending angles (`start` and `end`) of the quarter donut in the bottom left of the image. Plot it using `geom_arc_bar()`.

Both a reference image of the quarter donut, and the image of the unit circle are in this folder to use as reference.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggforce)

quarter_donut_3 <- tibble(
  # Fill in donut elements here
  # x = ,
  # y = ,
  # start = ,
  # end = ,
  r = 10,
  r0 = 5
)

ggplot() + 
  geom_arc_bar(
    data = quarter_donut_3,
    # Specify aesthetics here
    # aes()
  ) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_void()
```
